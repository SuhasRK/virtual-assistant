# G.O.A.T (Virtual Assistant by python)

Do you want your PC to respond to your commands like JARVIS did to Tony? This is possible now with Python.Python offers some wonderful libriaries to build a virtual assistant.This assistant does tasks like searching information about a person from wikipedia,plays requested video on youtube,opens google chrome,play music from local disks,replies with present time when queried,opens VS code etc. At last I have included 2 more functionalities. Our assistant can send Whatsapp messages as well as Emails.But for this task to happen we must populate our assistant database with numbers and mail-id's
